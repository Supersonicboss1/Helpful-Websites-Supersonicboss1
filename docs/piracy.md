### Sigpatches

These Signature patches are for different boot methods, either fusee-primary, or hekate. These are frequently DMCA’d, so these links may no longer work.

- The [fusee-primary and hekate](https://github.com/ITotalJustice/patches/releases) patches are hosted by ITotalJustice

- An easy option for signature patches is [AutoIPS.](https://gbatemp.net/threads/autoips-sig-patcher.574126/) To use this, simply place your fusee-secondary.bin file into the AutoIPS directory, and run the Runme.bat file. This will generate a .ips file and instructions for patching hekate. Just place the .ips file into “/atmosphere/kip_patches/loader_patches/”, and add the patch to “/bootloader/patches.ini” if you are using Hekate.
