## Piracy

- [NXBrew](https://nxbrew.com/) is a piracy site containing most games you would want for switch, in DDL and torrent form.

- The [Switch Pirates](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchPirates/) Subreddit contains many things related to piracy, and can be very helpful if you run into any issues.

- The [SwitchNSPs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchNSPs/) Subreddit contains many game NSPs, and can be helpful if NXbrew happens to either not have it, or its link is down. Keep in mind older games's links will often not work.

- [JITS](https://www.jits.cc) is a "shop" for the switch homebrew app [Tinfoil](https://www.tinfoil.io) which allows you to download games directly on to the switch.
