# Emulators

This will detail places to get files for emulation, such as system firmware, and where to get the games

## Dolphin

Wii and GameCube games can be tricky to find, but a good resource is the [r/Roms Megathread Site,](https://r-roms.github.io/) which also has roms for other consoles/emulators.

## CEMU

CEMU is very easy, just download [Wii U USB Helper Launcher](https://github.com/FailedShack/USBHelperInstaller/releases) and add <https://titlekeys.ovh/> when asked for a title keys location. Then simply download and check the unpacked box.

## Ryujinx/Yuzu

Also fairly easy if you know where to look. If you have a switch, the tinfoil shops listed [Switch Piracy](piracy.md#Tinfoil) have many games which you can then dump with a tool such as [nxdumptool.](https://github.com/DarkMatterCore/nxdumptool/releases) A great source for the files with no dumping needed is the [Remastered](https://discord.gg/tuT59S2zcv) Discord server, and [NXBrew.](https://nxbrew.org) Also see [Switch Piracy](piracy.md#Nintendo-Switch)
