## Piracy

- [NXBrew](https://nxbrew.com/) is a piracy site containing most games you would want for switch, in DDL and torrent form.

- The [Switch Pirates](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchPirates/) Subreddit contins many things related to piracy, and can be very helpful if you run into any issues.

- The [SwitchNSPs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchNSPs/) Subreddit contains many game NSPs, if NXbrew happens to either not have it, or its link is down.

### Sigpatches

- The [Sigpatch Installer](https://github.com/HarukoNX/Sigpatch-Installer) by HarukoNX contains the latest Hekate and Fusee-Primary Sigpatches.

- The [FS, ACID,](https://github.com/HarukoNX/PKG2-Patches) and [ES](https://github.com/HarukoNX/ES-Patches) Patches by HarukoNX are an alternative to the installer, however they come from the same source, just a different installation method.
