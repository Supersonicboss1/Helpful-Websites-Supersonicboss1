## Piracy

- [NXBrew](temp) is a piracy site containing most games you would want for switch, in DDL and torrent form.

- The [Switch Pirates](temp) Subreddit contins many things related to piracy, and can be very helpful if you run into any issues.

- The [NXNSPs](temp) Subreddit contains lots of game files, if NXbrew happens to either not have it, or is down.

### Sigpatches

- The [Sigpatch Installer](https://github.com/HarukoNX/Sigpatch-Installer) by HarukoNX contains the latest Hekate and Fusee-Primary Sigpatches.

- The [FS, ACID,](https://github.com/HarukoNX/PKG2-Patches) and [ES](https://github.com/HarukoNX/ES-Patches) Patches by HarukoNX are an alternative to the installer, however they come from the same source, just a different installation method.
